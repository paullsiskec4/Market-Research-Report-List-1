<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Automated Ophthalmic Perimeters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Static Ophthalmic Perimeters</li><li>Kinetic Ophthalmic Perimeters</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Automated ophthalmic perimeters are classified into two main types: static and kinetic perimeters. Static ophthalmic perimeters measure visual fields at fixed points, providing a detailed map of vision loss by presenting stimuli at various locations while the patient maintains fixation. In contrast, kinetic ophthalmic perimeters assess visual fields by moving stimuli across the patient's field of vision, allowing for dynamic tracking of visual sensitivity. Both types play essential roles in diagnosing and monitoring various eye conditions, enhancing patient care.</p></p>
