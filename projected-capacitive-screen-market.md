<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Projected Capacitive Screen Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Self Capacitance</li><li>Mutual Capacitance</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The projected capacitive screen market is primarily divided into two types: self-capacitance and mutual capacitance. Self-capacitance measures the change in capacitance at each individual sensor, allowing for single touch functionality. In contrast, mutual capacitance involves a grid of sensors that can detect multiple touches simultaneously by measuring capacitance between intersecting rows and columns. This enables more complex interactions, allowing for multi-touch capabilities, making mutual capacitance suitable for smartphones and tablets, while self-capacitance is often used in simpler applications.</p></p>
