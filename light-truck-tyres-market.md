<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Light Truck Tyres Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Radial Tyres</li><li>Bias Tyres</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The light truck tire market is primarily divided into two types: radial and bias tires. Radial tires feature steel belts that provide improved stability, longevity, and fuel efficiency, making them ideal for highway use. They offer better handling and traction, especially in wet conditions. Bias tires, on the other hand, have overlapping polyester or nylon layers, resulting in a stiffer sidewall. While they provide a smoother ride and more durable construction, they are generally less fuel-efficient and not as conducive for high-speed performance.</p></p>
